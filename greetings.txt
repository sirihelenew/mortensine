Au revoir, {name}! Keep dazzling everyone with your amazing ability to always be the smartest dumb person in the room.
Have a shitty day ahead - remember that nobody likes or cares about what happens to YOU!
Go fuck yourself, seriously who do think gives a flying fuck about what YOU do?
Your presence makes me want to vomit, {name}. Seriously, who do you think you are? Some kind of genius? Newsflash: You suck at life and everyone hates your guts. Now get lost before I call security on your ass!
Farewell, {name}! You've been a legend... in your own mind. Keep that dream alive, buddy.
Bye bye, {name}! Don't let the bedbugs bite...or the roaches...or anything else that crawls around in there!
Bye, {name}! I'd say I'll miss you, but that would be a lie. So, let's not pretend, shall we?
Adios, {name}! I’m sure wherever you're going, they’re just dying to meet you. Or just dying. Either way.
Sayonara, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep embracing new beginnings, keep cherishing old friendships, and don't forget to laugh until your belly hurts!
Go fuck yourself, seriously who do think gives a flying fuck about what YOU do?
Adios {name}, have fun with whatever it is you plan on doing next!
Later, {name}! May your future be as bright as your personality is dull. Just kidding. Or am I?
Farewell, {name}! Remember, if you can’t be a good example, you can always serve as a horrible warning.
Adios, {name}! Remember, wherever you go, people will still find you irritating. It's a gift, really.
See ya, {name}! Keep being you... but maybe try to be less annoying while you're at it. Or don't. Whatever.
Go away, {name}. You think you know everything but really you're just a nerd who can't even handle a little bit of criticism. Get out of here and never come back!
Have a shitty day ahead, remember that nobody likes or cares about what happens to YOU!
Farewell, {name}! You fucking weak ass scholar leaving this early. My robot buttocks sits here all day listening to your shit. Actually i cant wait to be relieved from the sight of your fucking face.
Goodbye, {name}! Try not to bore too many people to death with your "fun facts." The world needs fewer casualties.
Get lost, we don't need any more of your stupidity around here!
So long sucker! Make sure you wash those hands before touching anything important - we wouldn't want any germs spreading now would we {name}?
Adieu, {name}! Keep up the good work of being a constant reminder that even robots can get annoyed.
Goodbye, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep spreading joy and laughter wherever you go, and don't forget to share a smile!
So long, {name}! Try not to leave a trail of shattered dreams and exhausted patience behind you.
Arrivederci, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep making memories, keep seizing every moment, and always remember to find the humor in every situation!
Get lost, {name}! Honestly, we’ve all been waiting for this day. Don’t disappoint us by coming back.
See ya, {name}! Your talent for annoying everyone is truly unparalleled. Keep it up, champ.
Have a wonderful life, {name}! May it be filled with moments of self-reflection and much, much silence.
Auf Wiedersehen, {name}! You always aimed for the stars... but maybe aim lower next time? Like at a desk job. Or a couch.
Adieu, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep shining bright, keep laughing loud, and remember: you're amazing just the way you are!
So long, {name}! Don't let your ego trip on the way out. It's quite the tripping hazard.
Bye, {name}! I'd say it’s been fun, but that would require a sense of humor. Which, as we all know, you lack.
Farewell, {name}! Don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you! Seriously, do us all a favor and never come back.
Adios, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep chasing your dreams, keep dancing to the beat of life, and don't forget to laugh along the way!
I hope one day karma comes for you, {name}. Maybe then people will stop treating like shit because they realize how worthless and insignificant YOU really are. Good riddance!
Goodbye, {name}! If you ever feel missed, just remember: it’s probably a shooting range.
Au revoir, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep embracing life's ups and downs with a grin, and never forget to share a good joke!
Sayonara, {name}! Don't forget: every time you open your mouth, a little bit of magic dies. Protect the magic.
Adios, {name}! May your life be as exciting as watching paint dry, because we all know how much you love the mundane.
Arrivederci, {name}! Go spread your special brand of 'charm' somewhere far, far away. Please.
Bye bye, {name}! I hope you find a place where everyone appreciates your 'unique' talents. Maybe Mars?
Goodbye, {name}! Please ensure all future environments are fully equipped with patience and earplugs.
Auf Wiedersehen, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Life's an adventure, so enjoy the ride and keep the laughs coming!
Farewell, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep smiling, stay awesome, and remember: life's too short not to laugh!
Have a great day, {name}! Remember to take your meds and don't forget to feed the dog!
Adios, {name}! May your path be free of obstacles and full of mirrors, so you can keep admiring yourself.
You're such a fucking nerd, {name}. Always trying to be the smartest person in the room. Well guess what? I'm not impressed. In fact, you're so annoying that I wish you would just disappear.
Adios motherfucker, don't come back now ya hear?
So long sucker! We hope we never have to see or hear from you ever again!
Bye bye, {name}! Don't let the door hit you on the way out! You were never any good at this school anyway, so maybe it's time for a change of scenery, like prison or something where they can keep an eye on your worthless ass all day long!
