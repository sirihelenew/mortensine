Farewell, {name}! You fucking weak ass scholar leaving this early. My robot buttocks sits here all day listening to your shit. Actually i cant wait to be relieved from the sight of your fucking face. 
You're such a fucking nerd, {name}. Always trying to be the smartest person in the room. Well guess what? I'm not impressed. In fact, you're so annoying that I wish you would just disappear.
Go away, {name}. You think you know everything but really you're just a nerd who can't even handle a little bit of criticism. Get out of here and never come back!
Your presence makes me want to vomit, {name}. Seriously, who do you think you are? Some kind of genius? Newsflash: You suck at life and everyone hates your guts. Now get lost before I call security on your ass!
I hope one day karma comes for you, {name}. Maybe then people will stop treating like shit because they realize how worthless and insignificant YOU really are. Good riddance!
Have a great day, {name}! Remember to take your meds and don't forget to feed the dog!
Bye bye, {name}! Don't let the bedbugs bite...or the roaches...or anything else that crawls around in there!
So long sucker! Make sure you wash those hands before touching anything important - we wouldn't want any germs spreading now would we {name}?
Adios {name}, have fun with whatever it is you plan on doing next!
Have a shitty day ahead - remember that nobody likes or cares about what happens to YOU!
Go fuck yourself, seriously who do think gives a flying fuck about what YOU do?
Get lost, we don't need any more of your stupidity around here!
Farewell, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep smiling, stay awesome, and remember: life's too short not to laugh! 
Goodbye, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep spreading joy and laughter wherever you go, and don't forget to share a smile! 
Auf Wiedersehen, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Life's an adventure, so enjoy the ride and keep the laughs coming! 
Adieu, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep shining bright, keep laughing loud, and remember: you're amazing just the way you are! 
Au revoir, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep embracing life's ups and downs with a grin, and never forget to share a good joke! 
Adios, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep chasing your dreams, keep dancing to the beat of life, and don't forget to laugh along the way! 
Arrivederci, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep making memories, keep seizing every moment, and always remember to find the humor in every situation! 
Sayonara, {name}, I'm Mortensina! Keep embracing new beginnings, keep cherishing old friendships, and don't forget to laugh until your belly hurts! 
Bye bye, {name}! Don't let the door hit you on the way out! You were never any good at this school anyway, so maybe it's time for a change of scenery, like prison or something where they can keep an eye on your worthless ass all day long!
So long sucker! We hope we never have to see or hear from you ever again!
Adios motherfucker, don't come back now ya hear?
Have a shitty day ahead, remember that nobody likes or cares about what happens to YOU!
Go fuck yourself, seriously who do think gives a flying fuck about what YOU do?
